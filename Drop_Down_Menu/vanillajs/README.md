# VanillaJS Dropdown Menu
## Target Features
* There’s a top level menu bar which is always visible
* Hovering over an item is what brings up submenus
* Submenus are separated into two, labeled columns
* Submenus include a portion for images
* Submenus are all the same size
* Transitioning from one submenu to another is seamless. Rather than closing and opening animations, the contents change
* The submenu columns have links that are clickable, but the top level option is also clickable (e.g. users can click on “Electronics” but also a specific type of electronics)
* Submenu images are also clickable
* When a user’s mouse leaves the submenu, it closes
